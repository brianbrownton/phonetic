A POSIX commandline tool to turn a string into the NATO phonetic equivalent.

Having not personally been in the military or had to do much work on radios, I find it difficult to come up with the right words to use when giving postal codes, confirmation numbers, references numbers, etc., over the phone to people.

Now I can just paste them in my terminal and know how to say them clearly and unmistakably over the phone.
